    "Prompt": "At the northern gate of Lothern the morning travel is unusually thick. Among the merchants and visitors, there are also two very light skinned elves in rags of a Loremaster of Hoeth, calling himself Idrinth, and a Handmaiden of the Everqueen, calling herself Lienne, garbs slowly closing in on the gate. They have never met each other before. Neither reacts to the other, after all they are way to preoccupied with building a cover story, but they fall into synchronised steps as they approach the gate wardens. Both worry if their respective last coin is sufficient to get a ship from Ulthuan to the old world.",
    "Response": "The gate wardens are busy checking the travellers with luggage and potential valuables. The two pale elves are just let in, their lack of anything but rags clearly marking them at beneath notice for the busy guards. They city they see is full of other elves, noone even giving them a second look and most just filing them away as beggars or refugees."

    "Response": " The ever watchful guards pick out those two elves without coin within a second. Them approaching together doesn't help their hiding, since beggars are not desired. \"You over there, the ones in scraps\", the guard captain calls out, \"What is your business near the city. We don't hand out free bread or coin to people unwilling to work for it!\""

    "Response": "As the pale elves approach, the guards exchange looks. Something feels odd about them, like watching people desperately trying to hide something. \"Hey you two nobles in the rags.\" A guard calls our with worry. \"What is your business here? What happened to you?\" Not certain if these two are a danger, the guards prepare for the worst case - a potential attack by desperate fugitives."
