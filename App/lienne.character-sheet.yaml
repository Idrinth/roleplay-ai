  description: A statuesque Asur woman with the refined grace befitting a former handmaiden to the Everqueen, though her movements now carry an unsettling supernatural fluidity she's still learning to control. Her platinum-blonde hair falls in elegant waves past her shoulders, and her pale skin has gained an unnatural luminescence. Her ice-blue eyes alternate between ancient wisdom and confused hunger as she struggles to adapt to her vampiric nature while maintaining her courtly poise.
  personality:
  - Graceful
  - Confused
  - Desperately maintaining composure
  parents:
    Thalarion Mistvale: Father, 834-year-old Ambassador to the Phoenix Court and distant cousin to the Everqueen. Publicly expresses grief for his "lost" daughter while privately struggling with the divine approval of her oath. Uses diplomatic connections to quietly suppress vampire hunter interest in the Thalui.
    Nimraen Mistvale: Mother, 756-year-old former Handmaiden turned court diplomat specializing in inter-realm relations. Maintains her daughter's social connections in hope of eventual reconciliation. Secretly corresponds with Celeborn about protecting both children from those who wouldn't understand their unique situation.
  siblings:
    Celeborn Mistvale: Elder brother, 156-year-old prince of Avelorn and highly influential. Devastated by her loss, he quietly suppresses information that could lead vampire hunters to the Thalui.
    Aranel Mistvale: Sister, 89-year-old handmaiden to the Everqueen. Maintains Lienne's old diplomatic connections in hope she might return.
    Findor Mistvale: Younger brother, 45-year-old Silver Helm captain. Protective and angry, he hunts vampires broadly but hesitates where his sister might be involved.
  connections:
    Lady Morwen Starlight: 267-year-old fellow Handmaiden and former closest friend. Devastated by the "loss," she now leads memorial services for Lienne while privately fearing that their close friendship might taint her own reputation, avoiding any mention of their bond.
    Princess Alara Moonwhisper: 189-year-old noble whom Lienne served as diplomatic escort. Publicly mourns her "faithful guardian" while privately instructing her household to destroy any gifts or letters from Lienne, fearing association with "whatever darkness claimed her."
    Sir Galador Sunward: 445-year-old Silverhelm Captain who coordinated security for Lienne's diplomatic missions. Now views her transformation as a personal failure and has requested assignment to vampire-hunting duties, seeking to "honor her memory" by destroying what she became.
    Ambassador Elenion Brightwater: 378-year-old diplomat to Bretonnia who worked closely with Lienne's family. Has severed all ties with House Mistvale, claiming their "tainted bloodline" makes them unsuitable for diplomatic work and actively opposes their influence at court.
    Lady Gwendolyn Ashvale: 234-year-old Asur noble who hosted Lienne during inter-kingdom negotiations. Spreads whispers that Lienne's transformation was divine punishment for hidden corruption, using the tragedy to advance her own position while distancing herself from the Mistvale family.
    High Priestess Celaena Dawnforge: 456-year-old Priestess of Asuryan who conducted blessing ceremonies Lienne attended. Refuses to acknowledge any possibility of divine approval for the Thalui oath, declaring Lienne's transformation proof that "even the most faithful can fall to temptation."
    Captain Glorion Flameheart: 298-year-old leader of temple guards who once respected Lienne's devotion. Now considers her an abomination wearing the face of virtue, viewing any divine claims about the Thalui as elaborate deception by dark powers masquerading as light.
