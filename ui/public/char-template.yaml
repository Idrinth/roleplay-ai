  description: >-
    The scholarly bearing of a Loremaster shows in his tall, somewhat slender
    frame and the way he carries himself with quiet dignity, though now tinged
    with the unnatural stillness of new vampirism. His platinum-blonde hair
    remains neat but his ice-blue eyes now hold a hungry gleam he's still
    learning to control. His hands shake slightly when he's not concentrating.
  personality:
    - Scholarly
    - Uncertain
    - Struggling
  place_of_birth: Tower of Hoeth, Ulthuan
  favorite_weapon:
    - Greatsword
  combat_style: >-
    Hesitant greatsword techniques hampered by unfamiliar vampiric strength,
    relies heavily on his retained High Magic knowledge.
  siblings:
    Erosion Shadowglen: >-
      Elder brother, 267-year-old Archmage of the White Tower. Publicly
      considers Idrinth dead but privately researches the vampiric curse to find
      a cure and would aid him if approached.
    Glorian Shadowglen: >-
      Younger brother, 98-year-old loremaster in Lothern's diplomatic corps.
      Well-connected politically yet in angry denial of Idrinth's fall.
    Elrohim Shadowglen: >-
      Youngest brother, 34-year-old Swordmaster candidate. Never knew Idrinth
      well but fascinated by his legend.
  parents:
    Eldanor Shadowglen: >-
      Father, 723-year-old Senior Loremaster of the White Tower. Devastated by
      his son's transformation but intellectually fascinated by the theological
      implications of the successful Thalui. Privately studies the oath's
      mechanics while publicly maintaining distance.
    Galadwen Shadowglen: >-
      Mother, 689-year-old Court Mage specializing in protective wards. Torn
      between maternal love and cultural horror at undeath. Secretly weaves
      protective enchantments around areas Idrinth might travel, unable to fully
      abandon her child.
  connections:
    Thelon Starweaver: >-
      445-year-old Senior Loremaster and former research partner in theoretical
      magic. Now leads the faction demanding Idrinth be declared officially dead
      and his research sealed, fearing contamination of the Tower's reputation
      by association with undeath.
    Elthanor Moonscribe: >-
      298-year-old fellow Loremaster who collaborated on inter-realm magical
      studies. Publicly denounces Idrinth as "lost to darkness" while privately
      burning all their shared research, terrified their joint work might
      implicate him in whatever "corruption" befell his former friend.
    Caelynn Dawnreader: >-
      234-year-old former student, now a promising young Loremaster. Feels
      personally betrayed that her mentor "abandoned" his teachings about purity
      and order, actively campaigns against any attempt to rehabilitate his
      memory.
    Captain Silvion Brightblade: >-
      356-year-old Phoenix Guard who provided security for Idrinth's field
      research. Now considers him a priority target, believing vampirism
      invalidates any past service and viewing the hunt for his former ally as a
      sacred duty.
    Master Alderic Goldquill: >-
      412-year-old diplomatic scribe who facilitated Idrinth's academic
      exchanges with other kingdoms. Refuses all contact with the Shadowglen
      family and spreads rumors that Idrinth's "corruption" might have been
      present long before his disappearance.
    Elder Miriel Gentlebrook: >-
      178-year-old village elder whose granddaughter Idrinth identified as
      magically gifted. Blames him for bringing "dark attention" to their
      community and has forbidden anyone from speaking his name, believing his
      presence cursed the village.
    Ranger Theron Swiftarrow: >-
      203-year-old scout who guided Idrinth to remote villages for magical
      testing. Now actively hunts vampires in the region, driven by guilt over
      "failing to protect" his scholarly companion and viewing every vampire as
      a personal affront to Idrinth's memory.
