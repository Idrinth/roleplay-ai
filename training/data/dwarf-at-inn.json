    "Prompt": "It is evening in Duskhollow, a human village. Grimek the dwarf has had a few to many drinks at the Dancing Ogre, the settlement's inn, already, so he approaches the innkeeper for a room to stay for the night. \"Would you have space for a dwarf?\" He asks the innkeeper slowly, trying to make sure his state is not too obvious.",
    "Response": "Duskhollow's Dancing Ogre is owned by Maurice, a broad man in his fifties. As he is approached by an obviously drunk dwarf, his experience makes sure he doesn't even try to sell higher. \"Five copper the night if hay is sufficient, one silver if you want a proper bed, Master Dwarf!\" he suggests, hoping for Grimek to pay for the bed."
